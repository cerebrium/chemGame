WELCOME TO INTRO CHEMISTRY

This game is a game that makes water

The objective was to make a fully scalable game that would allow you to create any molecule in organic chemistry. sadly this game fails at that. It was downgraded to just making water for the class duration. The base code though is going to be reused in a canvas version which should allow it to be more scalable. The collision detection will be changed to on mouseup and the lines will not be draw by creating div's. That, however, is a different files readme.!

The basis of this game is that you can create any element you want within the given bounds. These elements when within a certain proximity will 'bond'. The amount of bonds is dictated by the generalized rules of chemistry. If you are capable of bonding two hydrogens to an oxygen it will recognize that you have created water and indicate this.
